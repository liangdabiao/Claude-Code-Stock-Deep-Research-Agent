## Quick Start

### Stock Research (股票投资尽调)

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Set model (optional, but recommended)
/model opus

# Execute stock research
/stock-research [股票代码或公司名称]

# Examples:
/stock-research 600519              # 贵州茅台 (A-share)
/stock-research AAPL                # 苹果公司 (US)

```

**The system will**:
1. Ask about your investment style (价值/成长/困境/红利), holding period, risk tolerance
2. Deploy ~28 parallel research agents across 7 phases
3. Generate comprehensive due diligence report in `RESEARCH/STOCK_[ticker]_[company]/`

**Time**: 2-4 hours for standard due diligence

## Stock Investment Research

### 8-Phase Due Diligence Process

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **1. Business Foundation** | 公司事实底座 | Products, revenue mix, customers, value chain, strategy |
| **2. Industry Analysis** | 行业周期分析 | Cycle stage, supply-demand, competition, policy impacts |

| **8. Final Synthesis** | 综合报告 | Signal rating, thesis, monitoring checklist |

### Investment Style Adaptation

The system adapts research approach based on investment style:

| Style | Focus | Valuation Methods | Key Metrics |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Value** (价值投资) | Intrinsic value, margin of safety | P/B, EV/EBITDA, DCF (conservative) | P/B, normalized earnings, FCF yield |
| **Growth** (成长投资) | TAM, competitive positioning | PEG, DCF (aggressive), user models | Revenue growth, moat, TAM penetration |
| **Turnaround** (困境反转) | Liquidity, solvency, catalysts | Liquidation value, option value | Debt ratios, cash runway, catalyst timeline |
| **Dividend** (红利投资) | Dividend sustainability | DDM, FCF yield, yield comparison | Dividend yield, payout ratio, FCF coverage |

### Quality Standards

**Mandatory Cross-Validation**:
- ✅ Profit vs. cash flow (OCF/NI ratio analysis)
- ✅ Company vs. peer comparison (key ratios, margins)
- ✅ Bear case analysis (3-5 key risks identified)

**Citation Requirements**:
- Every factual claim must include: Author, Date, Title, URL
- Source quality rated (A-E scale)
- A-grade sources: Annual reports, regulatory filings
- B-grade: Industry reports, analyst research
- C-grade: News articles, expert commentary

**Signal Rating** (based on fundamentals only):
- 🟢🟢🟢 **Strong Buy**: Significant margin of safety, strong moat, attractive valuation
- 🟡🟡🟡 **Hold**: Fairly valued or limited margin of safety
- 🔴🔴 **Avoid**: Overvalued, deteriorating fundamentals, excessive risks

### Example Usage

```
User: /stock-research 贵州茅台 600519

Claude: 我可以帮您研究贵州茅台。让我先了解您的投资需求：

       1. 投资风格：价值投资/成长投资/困境反转/红利投资？
       2. 持有周期：短期(<6月)/中期(6-18月)/长期(1-3年以上)?
       3. 关注重点：生意质量/财务质量/估值/公司治理 (选2-3个)
       4. 风险偏好：保守/平衡/激进？

User: 价值投资，长期持有3年以上，关注：生意质量、公司治理、估值，风险保守

Output: RESEARCH/STOCK_600519_Kweichow_Moutai/

🟡🟡🟡 Hold / Fairly Valued

Investment Thesis:
茅台是中国领先的白酒品牌，拥有强大的品牌护城河和定价能力。然而当前估值（P/E 32x）安全边际有限。建议继续持有现有仓位，但新投资应等待10-15%回调至¥1,750-1,850区间。

Key Metrics:
- Market Cap: ¥2.8T
- P/E (TTM): 32x (above 5-year average)
- Gross Margin: 91.2%
- ROE: 31%
- Moat Rating: 5/5 (Very Strong)

Top 3 Reasons to Consider:
1. Unassailable brand moat with 800-year heritage
2. Exceptional margins (91% gross, 53% net)
3. Strong cash generation (OCF/NI > 1.0)

Top 3 Reasons to Avoid:
1. Full valuation (P/E 32x, limited margin of safety)
2. Regulatory risk (government scrutiny of luxury pricing)
3. Competitive intensification (Wuliangwa narrowing gap)

Monitoring Checklist:
✅ Strengthen: Price pulls back 10-15% to ¥1,750-1,850
❌ Exit: Price drops below ¥1,300 (-35%), net margin < 45%

## Customization

### Adapting Stock Research Parameters

The system automatically adapts based on:

1. **Investment Style**:
   - Value: Emphasize balance sheet, normalized earnings, margin of safety
   - Growth: Emphasize TAM, competitive positioning, growth sustainability
   - Turnaround: Emphasize liquidity, solvency, catalysts
   - Dividend: Emphasize payout sustainability, FCF generation

2. **Holding Period**:
   - Short-term (<6 months): Focus on near-term catalysts, sentiment
   - Medium-term (6-18 months): Balanced approach
   - Long-term (1-3+ years): Emphasize business sustainability, moat, intrinsic value

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Conservative: Add filters (debt limits, minimum profitability)
   - Balanced: Standard risk checks
   - Aggressive: Accept higher volatility, focus on upside scenarios

### Customizing Output

Adjust research parameters by answering the question-refiner's questions with your specific needs:

- Geographic focus (China, US, global)
- Timeframe (3 years, 5 years, 10 years of data)
- Source preferences (annual reports only, include news, etc.)
- Language (Chinese, English, or bilingual)
- Valuation methods (DCF required? sum-of-parts?)
